# Library Project

### Library | The Odin Project | JavaScript

This is the first project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to build a somewhat-interactive library app that allows you to fetch basic details about books, add new books to the app, or even remove ones. [^1]

Specifically, the app is used to practice the usage of objects.

**Skills demonstrated: Intermediate HTML, Intermediate CSS, Intermediate JavaScript**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PAGE WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON MOBILE DEVICES**

[^1]: There is no association between the authors and publishers of the books mentioned in this project and me; I arbitrarily decided to pick a set amount of famous books and display their very basic details in the project.
