# Library Project

### Library | The Odin Project | JavaScript

This is the first project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to build a somewhat-interactive library app that allows you to fetch basic details about books, add new books to the app, or even remove ones. [^1]

Specifically, the app is used to practice the usage of objects. [^2]

**Skills demonstrated: Intermediate HTML, Intermediate CSS, Intermediate JavaScript**

**Webpage responsiveness: THIS PAGE WILL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY ON MOBILE DEVICES**

[^1]: There is no association between the authors and publishers of the books mentioned in this project and me; I arbitrarily decided to pick a set amount of famous books and display their very basic details in the project.

[^2]: Update: After learning about classes, the code has been refactored using the class syntax. It should be mentioned that the main logic behind the application subsists regardless of the change in syntax.
