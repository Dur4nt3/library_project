# Library Project

### Library | The Odin Project | JavaScript

This is the first project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to build a somewhat-interactive library app that allows you to fetch basic details about books, add new books to the app, or even remove ones.

Specifically, the app is used to practice the usage of objects.

**Skills demonstrated: JavaScript classes, storing and manipulating data with JavaScript objects**
